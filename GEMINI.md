# Project-Specific Instructions for Gemini

## Core Mandate

After every file modification (add, edit, or delete), you MUST perform the following steps without exception:

1.  **Update `documents/SPECIFICATION.md`**: Reflect the latest changes in the specifications.
2.  **Update `documents/TASKS.md`**: Mark completed tasks and add new ones if applicable.
3.  **Update `documents/CHANGELOG.md`**: Add a new entry detailing the changes made.

This is a strict requirement for all interactions within this project.
